# orcuskiller
Kills a C&amp;C server for the Orcus botnet software by flooding it with fake clients until the server software crashes for reasons which are still unknown to me.

This is the first time I've actually used C# for anything and it was an extremely rushed project with the bare minimum for effort put in. The code is *pretty* bad. I still don't know what proper C# conventions are.

You've been warned.
