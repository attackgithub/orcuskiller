# orcuskiller
Kills a C&amp;C server for the Orcus botnet software

This is the first time I've actually used C# for anything and it was an extremely rushed project with the bare minimum for effort put in. The code is *pretty* bad. I still don't know what proper C# conventions are.

You've been warned.
